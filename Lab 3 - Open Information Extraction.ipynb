    "# Lab 3: Open Information Extraction\n",
    "(Due 2019-4-18 12:00)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will be implementing an *open information extraction* system, almost entirely from scratch. Information extraction takes a body of freeform text and extracts the contained information in a computer interpretable form. The word *open* simply means that the text/facts are arbitrary, so it will work with any input rather than a specific domain (e.g. legal texts).\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, given the input:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Trolls really don't like the sun.\"\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "you may extract the \"fact\":\n",
    "```\n",
    "('Trolls', 'do not like', 'the sun')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach is based on the paper \"*Identifying Relations for Open Information Extraction*\", by Fader, Soderland & Etzioni. Parts have been updated with more recent, or more ML, techniques however (Q3 and Q4 match the paper; Q1 and Q2 don't). You don't have to read the paper as this workbook takes you through the process; this lab is also intended as a tutorial/opportunity to see one way such a system works. Some parts are rule based, as that's still often the case. Note that the several parts of a complete system have been dropped, as the lab would be too much work otherwise; consequentially it isn't going to work that well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps of the system are as follows:\n",
    "*  Tokenise and split on sentences *(provided)*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Part of speech tagging - token level\n",
    "2. Part of speech tagging - sentence level\n",

    "4. Relation extraction\n",

    "A simple NLP library, called `ogonek`, is provided. It has some basic functionality that you will require; this is for two reasons:\n",
    "1. This has to run on BUCS computers, and normal NLP libraries do not.\n",
    "2. To keep certain low level functionality consistent, so automarking is easier.\n",

    "Please submit your completed workbook using Moodle before **12:00 on the 18th April 2019**. The workbook you submit must be an `.ipynb` file, which is saved into the directory you're running Jupyter; alternatively you can download it from the menu above using `File -> Download As -> Notebook (.ipynb)`. Remember to save your work regularly (Save and checkpoint in the File menu, the icon of a floppy disk, or Ctrl-S); the version you submit should have all code blocks showing the results (if any) of execution below them.

The non-linearity, $\\phi(\\cdot)$ is up to you ($\\sin$ works). Remember to include the original features plus the value `1` when creating the extended feature vector (so it has a bias term).

    "While the previous step works very well you need POS tags to be super accurate, as everything else depends on them. You will now introduce context. This is done by calculating transition probabilities between tags and solving a Markov random chain using the forward-backwards algorithm (or just forward if you keep links; it's dynamic programming) to find the maximum a posteriori (MAP) POS tag assignment for the entire sentence. The adjacency matrix should contain $\\log P(\\textrm{second pos tag} | \\textrm{first pos tag})$.\n",

    "Advice:\n",
    "* Work in log space, to avoid underflow. Remember to `clip` the model probabilities to avoid `log(0)`.\n",
    "* Include a prior for the adjacency probabilities. Some combinations have a probability of zero, which will otherwise end badly when you take the log.\n",
    "* You need to use the probabilities from the logistic random kitchen sinks models. Remember to normalise them so they sum to 1 before taking the `log`.\n",
    "* The performance boost from this is relatively slight: Only 1.5% for the model answer. But going from 90% to 92% remains a substantial boost (it gets harder the closer you get to 100%! With tweaks, primarily training for longer with more data and random features, this approach (Q1 and Q2) can hit 99%).\n",
