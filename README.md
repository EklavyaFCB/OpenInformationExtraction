# Open Information Extraction

Information extraction takes a body of freeform text and extracts the contained information in a computer interpretable form. The word open simply means that the text/facts are arbitrary, so it will work with any input rather than a specific domain (e.g. legal texts).

Involves:
- Word Vector Gloves (using `ogonek`)
- Groningen Meaning Bank Dataset
- Speech Tagging
- Logistic Random Kitchen Sink Model
- Named Entity Recognition
- Relation Extraction
